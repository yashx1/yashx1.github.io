Dear Ankita,
<br>
Hi, <br>
This is Yash.<br> 
Sorry i don't have you email-id and Itisha will never let me contact to anyone who is close to her, so i had to create this page to reach you.<br>
Hope you are doing great and found Switzerland as awesome as you were expecting it to be.<br>
<br>
<br>
We never met but i heard so much about you from Itisha, sooooooooo very much that it feels like i have known you like forever. Ankita first of all, thanks a lot for being a part of Itisha's life. 
I am not sure that if you have idea about how much she loves you and how much important you are to her. Most of the time, when she talks, she talks only and only about you, for hours. <br>
She misses you so much, so very much she starts crying for you. She is blessed to have someone like you in her life and I really really wish from bottom of my heart that you guys never let go each other. 
<br>
To be honest, for me, i didn't have enough courage to write email this to you but i really don't know what to do. Ankita, for the starters, let me tell you this, I really don't know what I am to Itisha, but she is everything to me. 
I am in love with this girl for last 4 years. I love her so very much that it hurts. We both know that, Itisha is not like other girls and that is what makes me crazy about her more and more, everyday. <br>
Ankita, the only ray of hope I can see is You, who can guide me or at least share your journey, cause You are someone who is really close to her heart and someone with she shares every small thing. 
You are someone, who built her way to Itisha's life and made a place in her heart and i am just a clueless guy who is trying to do that.<br>
You wanted to be friends with Iti, and you did it but i am trying to mean something more than that, her soulmate.
<br>
<br>
Itisha made one mistake. She had a dream, to be loved by someone, forever and she chose a wrong person. And because of that incident, she shut that door to her heart, so hard that even someone trying their best for just to mean something for her, is failing miserably each and everyday. Ankita, i wants to be that guy, whom she always wanted to be with, the guy who loves her mroe than anything in the world, who always cherish her and adore her. But i am nothing to her, she resist herself at her best, to not to fall in love again. 
She is ready to spend her whole life with someone whom she doesn't even know but she don't want to accept someone, whom she likes and knows better. She is ready to accept someone who is, her mom's choice but not someone whom she chooses.<br>
She doesn't want to give a chance to life. She want to follow her mom's decision but not her heart's.
<br>
Ankita, i don't want to fool around, no time pass, i want to marry her, i want to grow old with her, i want to give everything to her which she always dreamed of. <br>
But she is not ready to let anyone ever, to come any closer. But even then i am trying my best to find my way to her heart, everyday. <br>
She is ready to accept that she always wanted someone like ME, to get married to, but she is not able to hear those violins or guitar when she thinks about me.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am not saying i am perfect or if anything happens between me and Iti, our life will be fairy tale. But i can promise this, whatever happens i will be always with her, i will do my best so that her lovely smile never fades away. <br>
If will be always there for all her joys and sorrow. I am just an average guy, who is trying his best to matter to Itisha.<br>
<br>
Have a great day ahead.<br>
And please come back soon, Itisha misses you like hell. <br>
Please.
<br>
